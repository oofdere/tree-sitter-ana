# tree-sitter-ana

wip tree-sitter grammar for [ana](https://github.com/oofdere/ana), a schema language primarily designed for defining atproto lexicons

api stability is not a concern at this point, as I'm concurrently hacking at the grammar and transpiler concurrently! so things will break if you depend on this grammar! you have been warned!
